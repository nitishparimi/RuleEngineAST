# Rule Engine with AST

This project is a simple 3-tier rule engine application that determines user eligibility based on attributes like age, department, income, spend, etc. It uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent conditional rules and allows for dynamic creation, combination, and modification of these rules.

## Features
- Dynamic rule creation and evaluation using Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- Backend support with a database for rule storage and metadata
- Simple UI for rule creation and management

## Running the Application

The application will be accessible at:
```
http://localhost:9000/create
```

### API Endpoints

1. **Create Rule**: POST `/create`
   - Request Body: `rule_string`
   - Example: `"((age > 30 AND department = 'Sales') OR (age < 25 AND department = 'Marketing')) AND (salary > 50000 OR experience > 5)"`

2. **Combine Rules**: POST `/mergeRules`
   - Request Body: List of rule strings to combine
   - Example: `["rule1", "rule2"]`

3. **Evaluate Rule**: POST `/evaluate`
   - Request Body: `{"age": 35, "department": "Sales", "salary": 60000, "experience": 3}`

## Example Use Cases

### Example 1: Create Rule
```json
POST /create
{
  "rule_string": "((age > 30 AND department = 'Sales') OR (age < 25 AND department = 'Marketing')) AND (salary > 50000 OR experience > 5)"
}
```

### Example 2: Combine Rules
```json
POST /mergeRules
{
  "rules": ["rule1", "rule2"]
}
```

### Example 3: Evaluate Rule
```json
POST /evaluate
{
  "data": {
    "age": 35,
